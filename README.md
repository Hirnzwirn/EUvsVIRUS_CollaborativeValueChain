## Project Description

Early stage preparation of the pharmaceutical value chain using up-to-date information from clinical trials

According to clinicaltrials.gov, there are more than 900 clinical trials active to investigate potential treatments against Covid 2019 at the moment. Their status is still unclear. The entire pharmaceutical value chain (incl. producer of chemical basic products, intermediates as well as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APis)) needs to be prepared at an early stage to ensure timely delivered medication. The current situation in the related pharmaceutical value chain, which is highly fragmented and distributed all over the world, is uncertain.

A Solution incl. Simualtion of different (and most likely scenarios and outcomes of these clinical trials) considering • Forecasting • Optimization • Composition • Legal and Supply Chain restrictions for stakeholders and producers in these value chains based on publicly available (e.g. pharmaceutical data bases based on the chemical components, eg. PubChem) as well as cross-company shared data will be developed.
